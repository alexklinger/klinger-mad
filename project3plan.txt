Project 3 Plan

For this project I want to use to the audio toolbox frame work to create a sample board that plays signature sounds from rappers when you press a button of their face. 

Design:
There will be buttons for six different rappers in two rows of three. I will use illustrator to make cartoon versions of each rapper. 

Pseudo Code:
- Create object for rapper.
- Use image of rapper as button.
- When button pressed, play corresponding sample.

Testing will make use of the iPhone 5 and iPad.
