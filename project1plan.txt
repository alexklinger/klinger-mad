Project 1 plan

	This project will tell the user who their local congressman is. They will enter in their zip code, and the name of their congressman will be displayed. For this project I will need to create a .csv file with every congressman and corresponding zip code, or find one online. Their will be an input field for zip code, and a label for displaying the information. Iâ€™m not sure how hard this will be, but I would like to add additional functionality if possible, like how to contact them with a provided phone number and/or email. This will be a feature I will add if I have time at the end. 

pseudo code: 

-   get zip code
check zip code against all in csv file (iteration)
display congressman name

Design:

The design will be simple because the app will only have 1 label and 1 text input but I will probably use some sort of simple logo and color to make it more visually interesting.
